## Description

* I created this project as a part of interview process at **500px**. The task is that i need to fetch data from the 500px API and integrate it into iOS application. 
* I used `UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout` to display image contents in various groups and which are part of a section. I have been trying to understand how compositional Layout works and i have the chance to implement it in this project, i learned how compositional Layout work. Now i need to focus on Diffable datasource.
* I used both MVC and MVVM patterns as my convenience to finish the project in time.
